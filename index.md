### **Profile**

>I am a Principal Hydroinformatics Developer within the Hydroinformatics discipline at Jacobs. 
>Combining my background in hydraulic modelling, hydrology and GIS with a passion for innovation 
>and technology, my role focusses on the development and application of digital solutions to a wide range 
>of challenges within the Water and Flood Risk industry. 
>
>I specialise in Python programming, in particular working with geospatial, scientific and numerical 
>packages such as numpy, pandas, scipy, geopandas and shapely. I have experience designing and integrating databases (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, sqlalchemy), 
>working with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS) and standard development practices 
>such as testing, source control, documentation and CI/CD pipelines.
>Outside of technical work I am involved in mentoring other team members and running learning & development initiatives for colleagues across the business globally to learn coding skills.
>
>I have worked in consultancy for 9 years, typically working with public sector clients 
>such as the Environment Agency, Highways England and Local Authorities. Throughout 2020, 
>I was seconded part time into Natural Resources Wales in their Flood Risk Analysis team, 
>gaining client-side experience in hydraulic modelling and hydrology.
>Throughout my career, I have demonstrated an analytical and innovative approach to solving 
>problems and have always kept a strong focus on continual self-development.



### **Selected Professional Project Experience**

> **National Flood Risk Assessment 2 (NaFRA2)**
>
>**Client:** The Environment Agency
>
>**Date:** May 2021 – Present
>
>I am currently working as a backend software engineer building the system for the National 
>Flood Risk Assessment 2 (NaFRA2), a pioneering cloud computing system to help manage 
>flood risk in England. NaFRA2 is perhaps one of the most exciting flood risk projects 
>in the UK in recent times as it brings together a wealth of data from various sources, 
>including local modelling data as well as new national modelling into an interactive 
>online environment which will be the first of its kind globally!
>
>I am responsible for the development of the core backend system, helping drive the 
>method development, and providing technical support and mentoring to junior members of 
>the team. 
>
>Once deployed, NaFRA2 will provide a novel and adaptive approach to managing flood risk 
>in England, and I am proud to be playing a crucial in its development.

>**Flood Modeller Python API**
>
>**Client:** Anyone!
>
>**Date:** Mar 2021 – Present
>
>I am currently developing an open-source python package designed to integrate with Flood 
>Modeller, the UK’s leading hydraulic modelling software developed by Jacobs. Soon after 
>joining Jacobs, I developed and pitched the idea of the API and was successful in securing 
>funding.
>
>The Flood Modeller Python API is the first of its kind in the flood risk industry, and 
>provides users with a new way of working with flood risk data unlocking myriad potential 
>use cases.
>
>In addition to designing and developing all of the code I have also produced 
>[online documentation](https://api.floodmodeller.com/), organised the testing by 
>developers and users, built the package to be 
>[distributed via the python package index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/floodmodeller-api/) 
>and have presented it through several internal and external channels.
>
>The project can be [found on GitHub here](https://github.com/People-Places-Solutions/floodmodeller-api)

>**OxCam Economic Investment Study**
>
>**Client:** The Environment Agency
>
>**Date:** Jan 2021 – Jan 2022
>
>I worked as a software developer on a pilot project for the Environment Agency looking at 
>optimising adaptive investment into flood risk management throughout the OxCam arc, a region in 
>England, to the North and West of London. I was pivotal in the success of this project, 
>developing a Postgresql database to catalogue and index results of tens of thousands of 
>model simulations. I also developed a several querying functions that allowed for complex 
>extraction of results based on a huge range of possible scenarios, and integrated this 
>with real time economic analysis.

>**Flood Risk Advisor Secondment**
>
>**Client:** Natural Resources Wales (NRW)
>
>**Date:** Jan 2020 – Dec 2020
>
>In January 2020 I began a part-time (3 days per week) secondment at NRW, originally for 
>3 months although later extended for a further 9 months. My role was to support the Flood 
>Risk Analysis team with their work including: reviewing hydraulic models submitted as 
>part of the planning process, building and updating hydraulic models to improve understanding 
>of flood risk to communities, and undertaking hydrological assessments of catchments to 
>assess their response to extreme rainfall. I also helped the team with general GIS and 
>automation, for example writing a script to extract, clean and organise GIS data from 
>their latest national flood risk dataset. 
>
>Until late March 2020 I worked from their Buckley Office in North Wales and undertook 
>site visits to some of the rivers I was working on in order to take survey spot levels 
>and to get a better understanding of the channel conditions. As well as gaining experience 
>and insight into working in the public sector and the statutory role of NRW, this opportunity 
>has given me experience in working in a different geographical area of the UK, being both 
>unique hydrologically and socially.

>**SIMBA – Rapid river & surface water model building tool**
>
>**Client:** Internal (AECOM)
>
>**Date:** 2019 – 2020
>
>Originally developed as part of an internal hackday at AECOM, I developed a tool written 
>in Python for ArcGIS which automates the initial set up and build for fluvial and pluvial 
>TUFLOW models. This tool provides great time-savings in the initial stages of a model 
>build and was presented to other staff across AECOM’s modelling team nationally. 
>
>The code behind SIMBA demonstrates a great understanding of geospatial problem solving 
>and knowledge of TUFLOW and include numerous complex processes including: iteratively 
>delineating catchment boundaries based on and area of interest and underlying DTM, generating 
>all necessary GIS layers for TUFLOW from input data, and creating and linking necessary 
>TUFLOW control files.

>**Modelling and Mapping: Greater Nottingham Tributaries**
>
>**Client:** The Environment Agency
>
>**Date:** 2019 – 2020
>
>I was the modelling technical lead for the Greater Nottingham Tributaries project, for 
>which hydraulic modelling was required for six watercourses throughout Nottingham. I 
>designed the modelling approach and supported the modelling from a technical perspective 
>as well as liaising with the client on a regular basis. All but one of the rivers in this 
>project were built as 1D-2D linked ESTRY-TUFLOW models.
>
>Through strong management of the technical scope and budget, I was integral in delivering 
>this package of work to good client satisfaction and within the agreed budget.
